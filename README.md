# Processing2C

**Scripts &amp; libraries for porting Processing Application (mainly simulations) into C++**

In my professional work as a computer simulation creator, I use Processing to create prototypes of models, which I often reimplement in C ++. This often means repeating a coder job that has already been done, which I don't like, so I finally created an automatic translator.
However, the Processing interface is quite extensive and I don't use most of its functions, so the library still contains a lot of "not implemented" functions.

**Quick start**

It need *SYMSHELLLIGHT* library in sister directory __SymShellLight/__ !

So go into your choice directory and run:

git clone https://github.com/borkowsk/SymShellLight.git

git clone https://github.com/borkowsk/Processing2C.git

Then go into __Processing2C/__ and and run __config.sh__ bash script.

See __./scripts/doc.md__ for more!
